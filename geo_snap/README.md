# geo_snap

A geolocation based app that allows users to take “snapshots” of their favourite hangout spots/venues/restaurants/picnic areas/etc. and then share them online. After sharing the “snapshot”, the user can add a title and location. Each “snapshot” can be liked by other users of the app and other users can also add their own “snapshot” to a location that will then be added to a library. The app is good for: Discovering new locations and sharing your own experiences. Created by Austin, Owen, and Jayson
